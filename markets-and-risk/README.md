# Markets & Risk — An Intuition-First Guide to Financial Risk

## What is this?
This repository is an intuition-first knowledge base that explains **how financial markets behave under stress** and **how risk is managed in real institutions like banks and trading firms**.

It is written for people who:
- Have little or no finance background
- Come from engineering or technical fields
- Are curious about markets, trading, and risk
- Want to understand *why* things blow up, not just the definitions

This is **not** a textbook.
This is **not** about startup valuation or accounting.

This is about:
- Markets
- Instruments
- Risk
- Failure modes

---

## What problem does this solve?

Many finance resources:
- Start with jargon
- Assume background knowledge
- Explain *what* without explaining *why*

This project does the opposite.

Every concept is explained:
- From first principles
- With real-world analogies
- With concrete examples
- In a way that compounds over time

The goal is to build **risk intuition**, not memorization.

## What this project focuses on

**Primary focus:**
- Market risk
- Lending risk
- Stress scenarios
- Margin and survival under extreme conditions

**Supporting knowledge:**

## Who is this for?

- Engineers entering finance or fintech
- Developers working with trading or risk systems
- Curious beginners who want real understanding
- Anyone who has heard terms like *exposure*, *gap risk*, *margin*, or *stress* and wants them to actually make sense

## How to use this repo

- Follow the roadmap sequentially if you’re new
- Jump to individual topics if you need a refresher
- Each concept lives in its own `.md` file
- Concepts build on each other, but each file is self-contained

This repo is designed to be:
- Readable end-to-end
- Revisitable months later
- Shareable with others

## Philosophy

> Markets don’t fail because people don’t know definitions.  
> They fail because assumptions break under stress.

This project exists to help you see those assumptions clearly.
