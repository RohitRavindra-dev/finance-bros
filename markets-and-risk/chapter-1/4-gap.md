# Gap Risk

## One-line intuition
**Gap risk is the risk that prices jump so fast you cannot react.**

---

## Real-world analogy
Driving at speed:
- Normal braking assumes gradual slowing
- Cliff = no chance to brake

Gap risk is the cliff.

---

## Financial meaning
Exposure assumes:
- Continuous prices
- Liquidity exists
- We can exit gradually

Gap risk asks:
> What if none of that is true?

---

## Concrete example
- Apple at $200
- Assumed stress: −10% → $180
- Actual gap open: $150

Loss is far larger than expected.

That extra loss = **gap risk realized**.

---

## Why gaps happen
- Overnight news
- Earnings
- Market closures
- Liquidity evaporation

---

## Why banks fear gap risk
Gap risk:
- Bypasses margin assumptions
- Breaks liquidation models
- Causes sudden losses

Most blow-ups involve gaps.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Gap risk = volatility  
❌ Gap risk happens often  

✅ Gap risk is rare but catastrophic

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Gap risk is why:
- Margin exists
- Worst-case stresses matter
