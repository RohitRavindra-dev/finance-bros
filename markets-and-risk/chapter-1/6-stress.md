# Stress Scenarios & Worst Gap

## One-line intuition
A **stress** is a predefined bad market scenario.

Worst gap = the stress that causes the most damage.

---

## Engineering analogy
Stress tests are like:
- Load tests
- Chaos experiments

They ask:
> What breaks first?

---

## Financial meaning
Examples of stresses:
- Equity markets down 20%
- Rates spike 200 bps
- Single stock gaps 40%

For each stress:
- Loss is calculated
- Exposure is aggregated

---

## Worst gap
From all stresses:
> Pick the one with the largest loss.

Banks always assume the worst plausible case.

---

## Why this feels conservative
Because it is.

Risk management optimizes for:
> Survival, not elegance.

---

## Why CUSIPs are removed during analysis
Removing CUSIPs answers:
> Is this loss real risk or bad data?

It is diagnosis, not manipulation.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Worst gap is unrealistic  
❌ Stress = prediction  

✅ Stress is preparation

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Stress + worst gap drive:
- Margin levels
- Credit limits
- Risk decisions
