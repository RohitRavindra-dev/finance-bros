# Micro vs Macro Dispersion

## One-line intuition
Dispersion answers:
> “Are my risks actually independent, or just different-looking versions of the same bet?”

Many positions ≠ real diversification.

## Real-world analogy
You deploy 10 services.

### Case A
- All run in the same data center
- Same power, same network

Looks diversified.
One outage → everything fails.

### Case B
- Different regions
- Different providers

Now failures don’t stack.

That difference is dispersion.

## Micro Dispersion (superficial)
Micro dispersion means:
- Many CUSIPs
- Different names
- Different positions

But:
- Same sector
- Same signals
- Same liquidity
- Same macro drivers

Example:
- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta

Different stocks.
Same risk driver.

---

## Macro Dispersion (real)
Macro dispersion means:
- Exposure to different **independent forces**

Examples:
- Tech equities
- Government bonds
- Oil futures
- FX carry
- Volatility strategies

Under stress:
- Some lose
- Some gain
- Losses don’t stack perfectly

---

## Why micro dispersion fools people
In calm markets:
- Correlations look low
- Diversification looks real

In stress:
- Shared drivers dominate
- Losses cluster
- Worst gap explodes

This is why:
> “We removed one bad CUSIP but risk stayed high.”

---

## Why banks care
Risk systems:
- Penalize correlated positions
- Do not give full diversification credit

Because micro dispersion collapses exactly when it matters.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Many positions = safe  
❌ Different tickers = independent  

✅ Independence of drivers is what matters

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Micro vs macro dispersion explains:
- Why worst gap concentrates
- Why margin spikes suddenly
- Why removing a single CUSIP often doesn’t fix risk
