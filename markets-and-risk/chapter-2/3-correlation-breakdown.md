# Correlation Breakdown Under Stress

## One-line intuition
Correlation breakdown means:
> Diversification assumptions stop working when fear dominates.

---

## What “breakdown” actually means
Despite the name:
- Correlation doesn’t disappear
- It **spikes**

Assets that were assumed independent:
- Move together
- In the worst possible direction

---

## Why this happens
### 1. Forced selling
- Margin calls
- Risk limits breached
- Funds liquidate everything

### 2. Liquidity disappears
- Buyers vanish
- Prices jump to clear markets

### 3. Human behavior
- Survival > optimization
- Everyone reduces risk at once

---

## Concrete example
Portfolio holds:
- Equities
- Credit
- Emerging markets

Normal correlations: ~0.3–0.5  
Stress correlations: ~0.8–0.95

Losses stack → worst gap explodes.

---

## Why this destroys micro dispersion
Many CUSIPs,
Same macro shock.

Diversification was illusionary.

---

## Why banks model this explicitly
Risk models:
- Increase correlations under stress
- Override historical estimates
- Use “risk-on / risk-off” regimes

This is intentional pessimism.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Correlation breakdown is rare  
❌ Models are wrong when this happens  

✅ Models must assume this happens

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Correlation breakdown is the mechanism behind:
- Worst gap scenarios
- Margin spikes
- Systemic losses
