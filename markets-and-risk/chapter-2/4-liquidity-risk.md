# Liquidity Risk

## One-line intuition
Liquidity risk is:
> The risk that you cannot exit positions when you need to.

---

## Real-world analogy
You own a house worth ₹1 crore.

On paper: valuable  
If no buyers exist: illiquid

Value without liquidity is meaningless under stress.

---

## Financial meaning
Liquidity risk answers:
- Can I trade?
- How fast?
- At what price impact?

In stress:
- Liquidity disappears
- Prices gap to find buyers

---

## Why liquidity matters for gap risk
Even if price movement is modest:
- No buyers → price jumps
- Exit price much worse than expected

That extra loss is often labeled as “gap”.

---

## Hidden liquidity concentration
Liquidity often disappears:
- Across venues
- Across assets
- Across strategies

This creates correlated gaps.

---

## HFT-specific nuance
HFTs are fast **only if markets exist**.

When:
- Trading halts
- Order books empty

Speed is irrelevant.

---

## Why banks fear illiquid assets
Illiquid positions:
- Get large stress assumptions
- Get higher margins
- Dominate worst-gap calculations

Sometimes margin ≈ position value.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Liquidity is always there  
❌ Big markets = liquid markets  

✅ Liquidity is fragile and regime-dependent

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Liquidity risk amplifies:
- Gap risk
- Correlation breakdown
- Worst-case stress losses
