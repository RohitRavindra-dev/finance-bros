# Risk-On / Risk-Off

## One-line intuition
**Risk-on / risk-off describes the market’s collective mood:**
- Are people comfortable taking risk?
- Or are they prioritizing survival?

It is not a strategy.
It is not an asset.
It is a **regime**.

---

## The simplest possible explanation

Markets constantly oscillate between two modes:

### Risk-On
> “Things feel okay. Let’s take chances.”

### Risk-Off
> “Something feels wrong. Reduce exposure. Preserve capital.”

Almost every large market move can be explained by this shift.

---

## Real-world analogy (very important)

### Normal day (risk-on)
- People drive fast
- Take shortcuts
- Invest time in long-term plans
- Assume tomorrow will look like today

### Fire alarm goes off (risk-off)
- Everyone stops what they’re doing
- Heads for exits
- Drops optimization, focuses on survival

Same people.
Same building.
Different regime.

## What happens in **Risk-On** markets

### Typical behavior
- Investors buy:
  - Stocks
  - Emerging markets
  - High-yield bonds
  - Crypto
- Volatility stays low
- Liquidity is abundant
- Correlations appear low

### Mental model
> “Diversification works.”

This is where **micro dispersion fools people**.

---

## What happens in **Risk-Off** markets

### Typical behavior
- Investors sell *anything risky*
- Rush into:
  - Cash
  - Government bonds
  - Gold
  - USD / JPY (safe currencies)
- Volatility spikes
- Liquidity disappears
- Correlations jump toward 1

### Mental model
> “Get smaller. Get safer. Now.”

This is where **macro risk dominates everything**.

---

## Why risk-on / risk-off matters for risk management

Risk systems do not fail because:
- They don’t know definitions

They fail because:
- They assume risk-on behavior continues

Risk-off breaks:
- Correlation assumptions
- Liquidity assumptions
- Diversification assumptions

---

## Connection to concepts you already know

### Correlation
- Risk-on → correlations look low
- Risk-off → correlations spike

This is **correlation breakdown under stress**.

---

### Micro vs Macro Dispersion
- Risk-on → micro dispersion looks real
- Risk-off → only macro dispersion matters

Many positions collapse into **one macro bet**.

---

### Gap Risk
Risk-off events often trigger:
- Overnight gaps
- Sudden repricing
- No chance to react

This is why worst gaps often align with regime shifts.

---

### Margin
Margin exists because:
> Risk-off happens faster than models can adapt.

Banks raise margin:
- Before weekends
- Before earnings
- Before known stress events

They are protecting against **sudden regime change**.

---

## Why risk-on / risk-off is not binary in practice

Markets are not switches.
They are **gradients**.

You’ll often hear:
- “Risk sentiment is deteriorating”
- “Markets are turning risk-off”

These describe:
> A transition phase where correlations and liquidity start behaving badly.

This is the most dangerous period.

---

## Engineering analogy (very precise)

Think of:
- Normal traffic → load-balanced system
- Incident begins → cascading failures
- Full outage → emergency mode

Risk-on = steady state  
Risk-off = incident response

Same system.
Different assumptions.

---

## Why this concept scares banks

Because:
- Risk-off overrides intelligence
- Human behavior synchronizes
- Models trained on calm data lie

This is why risk management is conservative by design.

---

## Common misunderstandings

❌ Risk-on / risk-off is a trading strategy  
❌ It applies only to equities  
❌ It is predictable  

✅ It is a regime describing collective behavior  
✅ It affects all asset classes  
✅ It emerges suddenly and spreads fast  

---

## Final mental model (lock this in)

> **Risk-on is about optimization.**  
> **Risk-off is about survival.**

All major risk events are transitions between these two.

---

## How this fits into the bigger picture

Risk-on / risk-off explains:
- Why correlation spikes
- Why dispersion collapses
- Why worst gaps feel “unfair”
- Why margin suddenly looks insufficient

It is the **macro lens** tying Phase 1 and Phase 2 together.
