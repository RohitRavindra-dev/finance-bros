# Bonds — A Complete Intuition-First Deep Dive

## One-line intuition
A **bond is a loan that can be traded**.

It is:
- A promise of fixed payments
- Issued by a government or company
- Bought and sold between investors

Everything else (price, yield, “attractiveness”) comes from this.

---

## Start from zero: the simplest bond

Imagine:
- You lend $1000 to someone
- They promise:
  - $50 every year (5% interest)
  - Return $1000 after 5 years

If you hold this until the end:
- You earn $250 total
- You get your $1000 back

This is **exactly how a bond works if held to maturity**.

So far, bonds look boring and simple.

---

## The missing idea (the most important one)

> **Bonds can be SOLD before they mature.**

This single fact creates:
- Bond price
- Yield
- Gains and losses
- “More attractive / less attractive” bonds

If bonds could not be sold, none of these concepts would exist.

---

## Anatomy of a bond (fixed at issuance)

Every bond has these properties:

### 1. Face Value (Principal)
- The amount borrowed
- Usually $1000
- Paid back at maturity

---

### 2. Coupon
- Fixed interest payment
- Example: 5% of face value
- Pays $50/year on a $1000 bond

**Coupon never changes. Ever.**

---

### 3. Maturity
- Date when bond ends
- On that date:
  - Principal is repaid
  - Bond ceases to exist

---

### 4. Issuer
- Government or company
- Determines credit risk

---

## What is bond price? (THIS is where confusion starts)

> **Bond price = what someone is willing to pay TODAY for the remaining future payments.**

Bond price is NOT:
- Face value
- Coupon
- Total money you’ll earn

Bond price exists only because:
> Bonds are tradeable loans.

---

## Why would bond price change?

Because **the world changes**, not the bond.

Specifically:
- Interest rates change
- Risk sentiment changes
- Alternative investments change

Your bond stays the same.
New bonds do not.

---

## Interest rates vs coupon (critical distinction)

❌ Interest rate = bond coupon  
✅ Coupon is fixed, interest rates are market conditions

Interest rates are influenced by:
- Central banks (Fed, RBI, ECB)
- Inflation
- Economic growth
- Risk-on / risk-off sentiment

Issuers respond to rates — they do not control them.

---

## Example: Interest rates FALL

Your bond:
- Face value: $1000
- Coupon: 5% ($50/year)

Now imagine:
- New bonds are issued at 3% ($30/year)

Your bond pays **more cash** than new bonds.

So buyers say:
> “I’ll pay MORE than $1000 for this bond.”

Example:
- Buyer pays you $1100
- Still receives:
  - $50/year
  - $1000 at maturity

Your bond is now **more attractive**.

---

## Example: Interest rates RISE

New bonds now pay:
- 7% ($70/year)

Your bond pays only $50/year.

Buyers say:
> “I’ll only buy this if it’s cheaper.”

Example:
- Buyer pays you $900
- Still receives:
  - $50/year
  - $1000 at maturity

Your bond is now **less attractive**.

---

## Yield — explained correctly

> **Yield answers: “If I buy this bond at today’s price, what return do I get?”**

Same bond, different prices:

- Buy at $1000 → 5% yield
- Buy at $900 → higher yield
- Buy at $1100 → lower yield

### Core rule (memorize this)
> **Bond price ↑ → Yield ↓**  
> **Bond price ↓ → Yield ↑**

This inverse relationship is everything in bond markets.

---

## Primary vs Secondary markets

### Primary market (creation)
- Issuer sells bond
- Money goes to issuer
- Happens once

---

### Secondary market (trading)
- Investors buy/sell bonds
- Issuer is NOT involved
- Bond price is discovered here

This is where:
- Price changes
- Yield changes
- Liquidity matters

---

## “How does the issuer know who owns the bond?”

They don’t need to.

Ownership is tracked by:
- Central depositories
- Clearing and settlement systems

Think of them as:
> The database of record for financial ownership

When interest is paid:
- Issuer sends money to system
- System sends it to current owner

Ownership can change freely.

---

## Why bonds thrive in risk-off

In bad times, people stop asking:
> “How do I make money?”

They start asking:
> “How do I not lose money?”

Bonds offer:
- Predictable cash flows
- Legal priority over stocks
- High liquidity (especially government bonds)

So demand rises → prices rise → yields fall.

This is fear, not optimism.

---

## Not all bonds are safe

### Government bonds (strong countries)
- Very low default risk
- Often rise in crises

### Corporate bonds
- Depends on company health
- Can behave like stocks in stress

### Junk bonds
- High yield
- High default risk
- Collapse in risk-off

“Bonds are safe” is an oversimplification.

---

## Why banks care deeply about bonds

Banks like bonds because:
- Cash flows are predictable
- They are liquid
- They are accepted as collateral
- They stress more cleanly than stocks

This is why:
- Bonds get lower margin
- Government bonds can hedge risk

---

## Final mental model (lock this in)

- Coupon = fixed promise  
- Price = market value of future cash  
- Yield = return based on today’s price  
- Price moves because bonds are tradeable  

If bonds weren’t tradeable, none of this would exist.
