# Stocks vs Bonds — Ownership vs Lending

## One-line intuition
**Stocks = ownership**  
**Bonds = lending**

Every difference between them flows from this.

## Start with a human analogy

Your friend starts a business.

### Option A: Buy ownership (Stock-like)
- You give $10,000
- You own 10%
- If business succeeds → upside
- If it fails → you may lose everything

Unlimited upside. Real downside.

---

### Option B: Lend money (Bond-like)
- You lend $10,000
- You get fixed interest
- You get money back at the end

Limited upside. Higher certainty.

---

## What a stock really is

When you buy a stock:
- You own part of a company
- Your value depends on:
  - Future profits
  - Growth expectations
  - Sentiment

Stocks are **residual claims**:
- Everyone else gets paid first
- You get what’s left (if anything)

---

## What a bond really is

When you buy a bond:
- You lend money
- You get fixed payments
- You have legal priority

Bonds are **senior claims**:
- Paid before shareholders
- Structured for survival, not growth

---

## Risk profile comparison

### Stocks
- Can go to zero
- Can 10x
- Highly volatile
- Gap frequently

---

### Bonds
- Usually don’t go to zero
- Upside capped
- Lower volatility (usually)
- Priority in bankruptcy

---

## Behavior in risk-on / risk-off

### Risk-On
- Investors seek growth
- Stocks rise
- Volatility stays low
- Bonds underperform

---

### Risk-Off
- Investors seek safety
- Stocks sell off
- Correlations spike
- Government bonds rally

This is rational behavior, not superstition.

---

## Why bonds hedge stocks (usually)

In crises:
- Stocks represent uncertainty
- Bonds represent certainty

So money flows:
> Out of ownership → into lending

This is why mixed portfolios survive stress better.

---

## Important caveat (very important)

Not all bonds hedge stocks.

- Corporate bonds can fall with stocks
- Junk bonds often behave like equities
- Long-term bonds can be volatile

Risk depends on:
- Issuer quality
- Maturity
- Liquidity

---

## Why banks treat them differently

From a risk perspective:

### Stocks
- High volatility
- Strong correlation in stress
- Large gap risk
- High margin

---

### Bonds
- Predictable cash flows
- Lower gap risk (govt bonds)
- Better collateral
- Lower margin

Margin encodes this difference.

---

## Connection to worst-gap thinking

Worst gaps are usually driven by:
- Equities
- Equity-like instruments

Government bonds often:
- Cushion losses
- Reduce worst-case outcomes

This is macro dispersion in action.

---

## Engineering analogy

Stocks are like:
- Performance-based pay
- Stock options
- Variable outcomes

Bonds are like:
- Fixed salary
- Guaranteed contracts
- Predictable cash flow

Both have risk.
Very different failure modes.

## Common misunderstandings

❌ Bonds are boring  
❌ Bonds are risk-free  
❌ Stocks are always better long-term  

✅ Stocks and bonds serve different purposes  
✅ Risk depends on stress behavior  
✅ Mixing them changes failure modes

---

## Final takeaway (lock this in)

> Stocks reward success.  
> Bonds reward survival.

In calm times, success matters.  
In crises, survival dominates.

That single idea explains most market behavior.
