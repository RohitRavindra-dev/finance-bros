# Positions

## One-line intuition
A **position** is simply what a client owns or owes in the market.

If you forget everything else:
> Positions are the inventory of finance.

---

## Real-world analogy
Think of an Amazon warehouse.

| Item | Quantity |
|-----|---------|
| iPhone 15 | 1,000 |
| Samsung TV | 200 |

That table is inventory.

In markets:
- Items = financial instruments
- Quantity = how much you own or owe

---

## Financial meaning
A position answers two questions:
1. **What** do we hold?
2. **How much** do we hold?

Examples:
- Long 100,000 shares of Apple
- Short 50 futures contracts of NIFTY
- Long $20M of government bonds

Each of these is a position.

---

## Long vs Short (critical)
- **Long** → you benefit if price goes up
- **Short** → you benefit if price goes down

Risk always depends on direction.

---

## Why banks care about positions
Every risk calculation starts here:
- Exposure
- Margin
- Stress losses
- Liquidity risk

No positions → no risk model.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Position = investment  
❌ Position = strategy  

✅ Position = raw factual holding

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Positions are the **input** to:
- Exposure
- Gap risk
- Stress testing
- Margin

Everything builds on this.
