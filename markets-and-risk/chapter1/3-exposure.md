# Exposure

## One-line intuition
**Exposure is how much money the bank can lose if things go wrong.**

Not how much is invested.
Not how much is owned.
How much can be **lost**.

## Real-world analogy
You lend ₹10L to a friend.

If they disappear tomorrow:
- Your exposure = ₹10L

If they give ₹6L collateral:
- Net exposure ≈ ₹4L

Exposure is always about **downside**.

## Financial meaning
Exposure measures:
> Loss if markets move against positions before we can react.

It depends on:
- Position size
- Direction (long/short)
- Market movement
- Time to liquidate

---

## Simple example
- Apple long worth $20M
- Assumed worst move before liquidation: −10%

Exposure ≈ $2M

---

## Direction matters
- Long positions → risk when prices fall
- Short positions → risk when prices rise

Exposure is asymmetric.

---

## Why exposure is not position value
Position value answers:
> “What do we own?”

Exposure answers:
> “What can we lose?”

Banks care about the second.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Exposure = total investment  
❌ Exposure = net position  

✅ Exposure = potential loss

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Exposure feeds directly into:
- Margin
- Stress losses
- Worst-gap selection
