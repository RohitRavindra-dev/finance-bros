# Margin

## One-line intuition
**Margin is money the bank takes upfront to protect against exposure and gap risk.**

---

## Real-world analogy
Security deposit when renting a flat.

Not a penalty.
A buffer.

---

## Financial meaning
Margin is:
- Client’s money
- Held by the bank
- Used only if losses occur

It exists because:
- Markets move
- Models fail
- Gaps happen

---

## How margin is determined
Margin ≈
- Expected exposure
- + gap buffer
- + liquidity buffer

Higher risk → higher margin.

---

## Margin calls
When:
> Required margin > posted margin

The bank demands:
- More cash
- Or reduced positions

---

## What happens if margin is not met
- Trading blocked
- Positions reduced
- Forced liquidation

This is enforcement, not negotiation.

---

## Common misunderstandings
❌ Margin is a fee  
❌ Margin means client is risky  

✅ Margin is survival engineering

---

## How this connects to other concepts
Margin depends on:
- Exposure
- Gap risk
- Stress scenarios
