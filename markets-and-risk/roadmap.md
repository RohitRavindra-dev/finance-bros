# Roadmap — Markets & Risk

This roadmap is organized to build **intuition first**, then layer mechanics on top.

Each phase builds on the previous one.

---

## Phase 0: Mental Setup
Understanding what problem this domain solves.

- What markets are (vs businesses)
- Why risk exists
- Why banks are conservative by design

---

## Phase 1: Core Risk Spine (Foundations)

These concepts form the backbone of everything else.

1. Positions
2. CUSIPs and identifiers
3. Exposure
4. Gap Risk
5. Margin
6. Stress Scenarios
7. Worst-Case (Worst Gap) Thinking

> After this phase, risk conversations start making sense.

---

## Phase 2: Why Diversification Fails

Understanding clustering and failure modes.

8. Micro vs Macro Dispersion
9. Correlation
10. Correlation Breakdown Under Stress
11. Liquidity Risk

> This phase explains *why losses stack together*.

---

## Phase 3: Market Instruments (What Actually Trades)

Instruments explained through risk behavior, not formulas.

12. Stocks vs Bonds
13. Futures
14. Options
15. Swaps
16. FX Basics

> Focus: how these instruments behave under stress.

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Risk Mechanics

How institutions operationalize risk.

17. Stress Testing Design
18. Haircuts
19. Netting & Offsets
20. Margin Calls & Forced Liquidation
21. Overnight vs Intraday Risk

---

## Phase 5: Real-World Failure Modes

Learning from reality.

22. Famous Market Blow-Ups
23. Why Models Lie
24. Human Behavior in Crises
25. Why “Safe” Strategies Fail

---

## End Goal

After completing this roadmap, you should be able to:
- Hold confident conversations with risk and trading teams
- Understand why numbers spike in stress
- Reason about worst-case scenarios
- Debug risk outputs at a conceptual level

This is **risk literacy**, not finance trivia.
